S&P 500 Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
Overview
This research project explores the application of machine learning algorithms to predict stock prices for the S&P 500. By leveraging historical data, the model aims to provide predictions with a 60% accuracy over the last few months of data.

The entire implementation is designed for simplicity and reproducibility using a Python notebook, making it easy for others to follow and replicate the results.

Features
Data-Driven Predictions: Predicts S&P 500 stock prices using historical market data.
Machine Learning Model: Implements a predictive model based on historical trends and patterns observed in the S&P 500 index.
Python Notebook: All code and results are contained within a Jupyter notebook for ease of use and transparency.
60% Accuracy: Achieved a prediction accuracy of almost 60% during validation over recent months.
Dataset
The dataset includes:

Historical stock prices of the S&P 500.
Market features such as trading volume, opening/closing prices, and moving averages.
Time range: A focus on recent years to capture relevant market trends.
Model Architecture
The model is built using:

Algorithm: Regression-based models or ensemble learning techniques (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).
Training Process: The model was trained using historical data of the S&P 500, learning from patterns like market fluctuations, technical indicators, and price movements.
Evaluation: The modelâ€™s performance was validated using metrics such as accuracy and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
